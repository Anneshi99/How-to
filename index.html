  <h2>Tips</h2>  
   <ul>
     <li>Use overnight rice because it's more firm and better when use to stir fry.
       <li>A pinch of salt to the egg give the egg more flavor.
         <li>Add the sesame oil near the end, if you add too early the flavor will disappear.
           <li>Remember to toss and stir throughout cooking so the flavor and temperature remains balanced.
